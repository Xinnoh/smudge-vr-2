Load "Beach_Waves.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the required particle effect from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Simply duplicate and move the particle effect along the coastline, using the smaller effect sizes to follow a shoreline with a tighter curve.

Have fun!
